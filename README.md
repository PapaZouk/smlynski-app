# Feedback and Navigation Project

This project is a web application built using TypeScript and Preact. It features a feedback display component and a responsive navigation menu.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- **Preact**: A fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Deno**: A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Deno from [deno.land](https://deno.land/#installation).
3. Provide necessary environment variables in a `.env` file or set them on the server side.
4. Run the development server using `deno task start`.

## Usage

- Navigate through the application to see the feedback and use the responsive navigation menu.
- The feedback component dynamically adjusts its height based on the content.
- The navigation menu toggles visibility on mobile devices when an item is selected.
